# Project "Green"

Green Lantern Green House Project

With our project, we hope to aid the students and faculty working in the greenhouse by collecting, providing and monitoring data for them. This subset of data would include moisture, temperature, humidity, light intensity, and UV index. Our ultimate goal is to use this data to be able to automate certain tasks, such as water pump activity and fan automation. 
1. Humidity
2. Temperature
3. Moisture
4. Light
5. UV Index

Using this data, we will be able to automate certain *tasks* accordingly.

These tasks include:
* Automated water pumps
* Automated lighting
* Automated fans
