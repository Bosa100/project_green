# Software List
* Raspbian
	* Operating system for Raspberry Pi
* Pip
	* A package managing system for Pythong software packages. We would need this in order to install Flask, which we will use to create the website.
* Apache
	* A collaborative software development effort aimed at creating a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available source code implementation of an HTTP (Web) server. There are tons of resources out there that teach you how to use it to set up a server on a Raspberry Pi. 
* Matplotlib
	* A 2D Pythong data visualization library. It allows you to display data as scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and many more. We will use to display the data from our database on the website.
* MySQL
	* Will be used to create the database our application will use.
* MCP908 Temperature Sensor Python Library
	* A Python library to work with the MCP9808 sensor.
* RPi.GPIO 0.6.3
	* Library that provides a class to control the GPIO on a Raspberry Pi. We are going to use this library to control the watter pump and many other things.
* ZWave API for Raspberry Pi
	* Python library that works with Z-Wave wireless products to enable the Raspberry Pi to control them.
* Pump Control Software
	* Software aspect we'll be creating ourselves. We will be using the RPi.GPIO 0.6.3 libary to create this.
* Arduino IDE
	* Arduino consists of both a micocrontroller (ESP8266) and a piece of software, or IDE that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.
* MQTT Protocol
	* ISO standard publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol. It works on to of the TCP/IP protocol. Will be used to communicate between ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi 3.
